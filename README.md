# MystiChron - Numerology Calendar

**MystiChron** is an elegant and mystical calendar application that combines the traditional Gregorian calendar with ancient numerological wisdom. Each date displays its numerological value as a superscript, helping users understand the energetic significance of each day.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Calendar Interface**: Beautiful, responsive calendar with mystical design
- **Automatic Numerology Calculations**: Each date shows its numerological value as a superscript
- **Master Number Recognition**: Special handling for master numbers (11, 22, 33)

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any device with a modern web browser
- **Modern Web Interface**: Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **No Installation Required**: Pure web application that runs directly in your browser

## üî¢ Numerology Formula

The application uses the standard numerology calculation method:

1. **Extract all digits** from the date (day + month + year)
2. **Sum all digits** together
3. **Reduce to single digit** by repeatedly summing digits
4. **Special cases**: Master numbers 11, 22, and 33 are preserved

### Example Calculation
For **June 8, 2003**:
- Digits: 8 + 6 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 19
- Reduce: 1 + 9 = 10
- Final: 1 + 0 = **1**

So June 8th displays as **8¬π** on the calendar.
