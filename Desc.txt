Use the Gregorian calendar style but now have an addition of the feature of numerology date as a superscript on each date.

The formula is still the same one as follows:
For example 
for 
8th June 2003 
will be as follows 
8+6+2+0+0+3 = 19
Refined to get the one digit as
1+9 = 10
1+0=
1
So on the calendar of June the 8th date will have the superscript of 1 on it and other days will apply the formula to have the same.

Only special cases will be for numerologies that add upto 11 22 and 33 since those are master numbers.
